# HistogramOfOrientedGradients
Experiment with Histogram of Oriented Gradients

This code is related to a PluralSight course:
Building Image Processing Applications Using scikit-image
by Janani Ravi.

The author uses the Jupyter notebook. In this case I used
VSCode with GitHub Copilot to experiment with the code in
the course.

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to learn is to read,
experiment, and repeat.

If you ar einterested in additional comments, I invite you
